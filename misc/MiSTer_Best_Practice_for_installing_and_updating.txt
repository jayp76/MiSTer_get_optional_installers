1) Installing:
Use either SD Card installer https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/SD-Installer-Win64_MiSTer 
or MisterFusion Image https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion/releases

2) Updading MiSTer Linux System:
Since it is unreliable to update via update script when MiSTer system is running, it's best to shutdown and use the SD Card installer and update boot files.

3) Recovering after update via update Script if your MiSTEr cannot boot anymore:
Use SD Card installer and update boot files to recover your system.

4) Use a generic BT dongle or 8bitdo dongle?
It depends. With a generic BT dongle you can pair multiple controllers.
With 8bitdo pair just on controller, but pairing is a bit more user firendly by pushing the sync button on dongle and controller. But you have to have multiple 8bitdo dongles for each used controller. 
It has also some features like changing D-Input mode to X-Input mode, and many more. These are mostly irrelevant in MiSTEr and can cause confusion.

5) 8bitdo controllers don not work after MiSTer 20200908 linux update:
Your controller is probably in "Switch" mode. Use "X-Input" or "D-Input" instead until a fix might be available in the future.

6) Which updater Script schould i use?
Firstly you should use the official one as a starting point. https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer -> update.sh
All other updaters are optional, but still a good time saver. Check which features the installers have and choose.

7) I want to use an older core, but don't want it to be overwritten via the updater script.
You probably can  do this via the updater script by modifying the ini file. But for some people this might be intimidating. 
Alternatively you could make an new Folder on the MiSTer "root" (/media/fat) for e.g. "_old_cores". 
Or use the "_OTHER" folder if already available. 
You have to use a leading underscore. Folders without a leading underscore are not visible in MiSTer Menu.

8) How do i get the latest MiSTer.ini file, without losing my user settings?
Add following line into your update.ini:

ADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES+=( "https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer|ini|$BASE_PATH/ini_examples" )

This downloads the latest MiSTer.ini to the "ini_examples" folder. Then you can compare this example ini file with your current ini and check which options were added/updated/deleted/obsolete. 
You pick which ones are usefull for your setup and add them to your current MiSTer.ini file.

9) Which method schould i use to upload files to my MiSTer?
It depends what you want to achive. Maybe the fastest and user friendly method is to activate a Samba share on your MiSTer.
If you want to secure your MiSTer you probably should consider changing the root password and transfer files via SCP or SFTP and disable Samba share.
My personal experience for transferring small files is, that Samba file share is fine, but not for big files. 
It is wonky transferring files from Win10 and progress bar seems to be frozen.
It also depends heavily on your network connection (Router/Switch/WiFi).
For large files it is better to use FTP/SCP/SFTP. You also have a "proper" progress bar when using one of these methods. 
Just don't forget to transfer your files in binary mode when using FTP/SFTP.

10) Mutliple MiSTErs on the same Network!
You have to change the hostname and MAC Adress.
There is a script and ini for the hostname in my github. It changes /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname.
For MAC address change use the Script in your Scripts folder called mac_address_change.sh. It is part of the official updater script suite.
