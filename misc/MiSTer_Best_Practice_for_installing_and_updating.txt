1) Installing:
Use either SD Card installer https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/SD-Installer-Win64_MiSTer 
or MisterFusion Image https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion/releases

2) Updading MiSTer Linux System:
Since it is unreliable to update via update script when MiSTer system is running, it's best to shutdown and use the SD Card installer and update boot files.

3) Recovering after failed update via update Script:
Use SD Card installer and update boot files to recover your system.

4) Use a generic BT dongle or 8bitdo dongle?
It depends. With a generic BT dongle you can pair multiple controllers.
With 8bitdo pair just on controller, but pairing is a bit more user firendly by pushing the sync button on dongle and controller. 
It has also some features like changing D-Input mode to X-Input mode, and many more. These are mostly irrelevant in MiSTEr an can cause confusion.

5) 8bitdo controllers don not work after MiSTer 20200908 linux update:
Your controller is probably in "Switch" mode. Use "X-Input" or "D-Input" instead until a fix might be available in the future.

6) Which updater Script schould i use?
Firstly you should use the official one as a starting point. https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Updater_script_MiSTer -> update.sh
All other updaters are optional, but still a good time saver. Check which features the installers have.

7) I want to use an older core, but don't want it to be overwritten via the updater script.
You probably can also do this via the updater script by modifying the ini file. But for some people this might be intimidating. 
Alternatively you could make an new Folder on the MiSTer "root" (/media/fat) for e.g. "_old_cores". You have to use a leading underscore.
Or use the "_OTHER" folder if already available. 

8) How do i get the latest MiSTer.ini file, without losing my user settings?
Add following line into your update.ini:

ADDITIONAL_REPOSITORIES+=( "https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer|ini|$BASE_PATH/ini_examples" )

This downloads the latest MiSTer.ini to the "ini_examples" folder. Then you can compare which options were added/updated. 
You pick which ones are usefule for your setup and add them to your current MiSTer.ini file.
